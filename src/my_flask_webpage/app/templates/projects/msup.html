{% block project_idea %}
MSUP is the abreviation for "Mechatronic Systems and Products". It is a module particularly designed
for mechatronics students at KIT. It aims to practice the complete development cycle of a mechatronic
product, from the idea to the final product including different milestones and a market launch at the end.
Moreover, it strengthens the ability to work in an interdisciplinary team.

<h4>Task</h4>
<p>One team consists of two subgroups of 5 persons each. The overall task is to stack cubes on top of each other
    using two different cooperating mechatronic sub-systems. One sub-systems is a moving vehicle to collect the
    cubes.
    The other one is static and has to stack the cubes on top of each other to a tower that should be as high as
    possible.
</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>
    I was part of the team responsible for developing the static system, where I focused on the CAD design of the
    entire system. Before the project, I have never worked with a CAD program. Despite the steep learning curve,
    I gradually built up my skills and was able to design two new subsystems with my team: the cube lift and the
    cube slide.

{% block takeaway %}
<p>
    For me, this project was very time consuming. As CAD designer in the static system's team I had to create a lot
    of parts in a very short time. I learned a lot about CAD construction and how to use CAD programs efficiently.
    It laid the foundation for my later internship as a mechanical engineer providing me with a lot of basic knowledge.
