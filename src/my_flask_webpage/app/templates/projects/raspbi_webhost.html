{% block project_idea %}
    Hosting a website requires a domain name and a server where the website is running on. I wanted to host my own website
    to learn more about web hosting and server management in general. Additionally, it is a great way to present myself
    and share some information about me with others. <br>
    A domain can be acquired quite cheaply. But hosting a webpage on a server is more expensive. A Raspberry Pi is a cheap
    mini computer that is light on power consumption making it the perfect choice for a web server.
    Starting with this, it opens up a lot of possibilities to host other services or to extend it to my own cloud server.

{% block takeaway %}
    <p>
        I always dreamed about having my own webpage. Finally, I had the time to make it happen.
        It was very interesting to learn more details about web hosting and setting up and configuring a server.
        This is only the beginning for further customization and extension of my server with more services e.g. a
        cloud or a self-hosted note-taking tool.
